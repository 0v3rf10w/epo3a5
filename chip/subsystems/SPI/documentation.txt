SPI documentation

inputs
-clk 
	clock signal
-reset
	signal that resets the spi master
-send
	when high and the spi is in idle it will start sending, when sending changing this signal will do nothing
-write_enable
	when high the shift register will read in new data on the next rising_edge
-write_in
	the data that will be written when write_enable is high
	
outputs
-busy
	indicates whether spi is busy sending/receiving signals
-sclk
	slave clock
-mosi
	Master Out Slave In
-miso
	Master In Slave Out
-ss
	slave select
	
the SPI interface is quite simple:
-it will start sending data when send is high and it will stop after 8 bit transfers
-it will read in new data when write_enable is high, doing this when not all of the data has been transferred 
 is undefined
-it will send the data over the spi ports
